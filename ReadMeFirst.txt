Initial Installation: 
A.  Download zipped folder from Github and extract (anyplace on the computer). This folder can be deleted after installation.
B.  Start Fiji > Plugins > Macros > Run
C.  Select the file named: "installer.ijm" within the downloaded and unzipped folder. 
    Due to a JAVA glitch, it may ask you to select the installer file twice.
    There are two files called "installer". One is an ".ijm" file and the other is an ".exe" file. 
    Make sure to select the .ijm file
    
D.  Restart Fiji.
E.  To run MeasureVescicleSize, go to the newly created tab Plugins > Macros > MeasureVescicleSize


For Windows users only:
Feel free to use the installer.exe file directly (without opening FIJI).
  Simply click on it and point it to the Fiji parent folder (folder containing the "Fiji.app" subfolder).
  The installer will install the file.
  Alternatively, the installer can search through your entire computer and find the fiji folder itself and perform the installation
